## Debugging

### What can I do to help?

1. First, please refrain from immediately resetting/uninstalling Docker for Mac:
   it will destroy the logs we need to understand the problem.
2. Make sure you are using the latest version of your channel (Stable or Edge).
3. Generate and upload the diagnostics (from the :whale: menu,
   "Diagnose and Feedback")
4. If you are running Stable, consider the possibility of checking whether the
   most recent Edge release addresses your concerns.  Because we continuously
   improve the Diagnostics, it does help us if you can provide Diagnostics with
   the most recent release of Docker for Mac.
5. Check whether there are [open issues](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues) similar to your problem
6. Create a new issue, with a meaningful title, the Diagnostic ID you obtained above,
   and all the relevant details.

## Versions of Docker for Mac

### Downgrading

There is no GUI interface to install a previous version of Docker for Mac,
however you can still download previous versions from here:

<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/>

Note the "Download" link for each release.

## Kubernetes

### How can I get logs

```sh
docker run --rm -it --privileged --pid=host justincormack/nsenter1 /bin/sh -c "cat /var/log/kubelet.err.log"
```

### getsockopt: connection refused

> When reading `kubelet.err.log` I have tons of:

```log

```

This is not a problem: this is `kubelet` trying to connect to API server when
the latter is not reading ready yet.
